## Yet another fake virus

Following the 1920 pandemic histeria, the 2020 coronavirus only seemed
natural and a lot of people saw it coming. Quick exlanation of it's nature - it
does not exist. Any kind of viral "infection" is not infectious,
because viruses are not transmitted between humans or animals, they are
manufactured by the body. Let's see the symptoms of the "virus" to see what
this craze is all about.

Symptoms of covid: fever, dry cough, tiredness, sore throat, diarrhoea,
conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on skin, or
discolouration of fingers or toes;
Serious symptoms: difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain
or pressure, loss of speech or movement.

Now let's compare these symtoms to the symptoms of a common cold:
chills, cough, fever, headache, muscle soreness, nose and throat
draining, sore throat, temporary loss of smell and taste, and watery eyes.

Since cold is a detoxification of the respiratory system, brain, and
various glands and nodes, no wonder the symptoms may affect breathing, and
even cause partial paralysis. But as you can see, obviously COVID IS JUST A
COMMON COLD. This explains its virality, since cold is bacterial and
fungal, but doesn't explain the hype. Your guess on this conspiracy is as
good as mine.

To get through this detoxification more easily, standard diet recommendations
for Cold are to be applied.
