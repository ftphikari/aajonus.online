# E.coli

E.coli are predominately found in the final stages of digestion in the
bowel. E.coli digest proteins and fats into finitely small molecules that
feed and nourish our brains and nervous systems. They are responsible for
producing massive amounts of B Vitamins to calm and soothe our brains
and nervous system. People who enema and take colonics to remedy their
constipation, continue the vicious cycle of devastatingly low colonies of
E.coli, causing malnourishment of their brains and nervous systems. That
may express itself in several symptoms, such as mild anxiety and loss
of mental acuity. So E.coli are responsible for nourishing our brains and
nervous systems.
