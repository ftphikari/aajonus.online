# Frozen Fish VS Frozen Land Animals

Frozen fish as long as that fish is from colder environment in the ocean:
salmon, not trout (trout doesn't do well frozen, it is a freshwater fish),
swordfish is fine frozen, tuna, all those will be okay frozen. I did not see
them create any kind of ill effect with animals. But your red meat, veal,
sheep, your normal goat (not mountain goat) all those meat frozen will cause
some deterioration of the animals that eat it.
