# Cholesterol, LDL and HDL

Many of you may not know that foods do not contain cholesterols, including
eggs, unless we drink blood of an animal. Cholesterols are made from food,
especially fats, by our bodies. When we eat raw fats, we do not construct
any "bad" cholesterol. If we eat fats such as margarine, we create bad
cholesterol, lipid peroxides and other toxic byproducts. When eating PD, no
fats are eaten from which our bodies can make bad cholesterols.

Any bad cholesterol that is made on toxic diets and stored intercellularly
or intracellularly may be detoxified at any time. On my PD, it is common
for people's cholesterols to elevate from 130-400. Since we on PD do not
synthesize bad cholesterol, the bad cholesterol that appears in our blood
is old toxic cholesterol from past toxic food. Our bodies utilize good
cholesterol to harness and cleanse bad cholesterol as well as all of the
immediate needs for bodily functions. We should be delighted if both good
and bad cholesterols are elevated because our bodies are removing the bad
gradually, daily. We should want and expect our cholesterols levels to
soar. We will gain better health quicker. In our toxic world, we cannot get
healthy quickly without high cholesterol levels.
