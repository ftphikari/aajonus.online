# Frozen Pastured Meat VS Fresh Supermarket Meat

I would rather go for the fresh, my laboratory experiments that i did with
regular supermarket meat, there was no diseases that caused degenerative
tissue, there was some vomiting some diarrhoea in a while but there was no
active disease, but i put a group of animals on a frozen meat and they all
developed skin disorders some of them got scurvy so i choose that which isn't
frozen. Now i lived on mad cow meat for 3 years and a half years when i was in
Paris. Because at Paris there were no butcher shops , only at carrefour
supermarket and that's what i ate. And i always eat extra fat with my meat so
it protects me.
