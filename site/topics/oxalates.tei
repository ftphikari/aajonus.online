# Oxalates

## One of many new-age deceptions

Random thing I found out about mold/fungus... the mold clings
onto/chelates metals tightly and digest it... then convert the metals into
oxalates before getting excreted out of the body. Turns out this is why
people are scared of oxalates. Because people with autism excrete up to
600x the amount of oxalates in their urine, they blame oxalates as the
cause of symptoms by association. When really the oxalates are used by
our body to detox the heavy metals that caused autism in the first place.
