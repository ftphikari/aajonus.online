# Do You Buy Chicken While Traveling?

Fowl is the only thing i don't touch when i travel, except in Asian countries,
i don't eat it because most of the commercial chicken is fed soy as their
protein source. Even if they say organic, that the soy has been fed organic
they have to process it and use a chemical treatment, because raw soy kills
any bird, any poultry. Just like Raw soy will kill a human. So it has to be
solvent and heat treated so it is a highly processed food. So i don't eat
chickens that are fed a lot of soy nor eggs that are from chickens that are
fed a lot of soy. If is over 30-25% soy i don't touch the eggs or the chicken.
