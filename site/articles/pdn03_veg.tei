# Fermented Vegetables; The Good, Bad and Stinky

There are many advocates, such as Sally Fallon, for eating fermented
foods, especially vegetables. Let's consider the fermentation
process. Fermentation is the bacterial and enzymatic process of
decomposing food. It is a form of pre-digestion. Considering that we
are not equipped to digest cellulose (vegetation) properly, fermentation
allows us to digest more of it. However, since there is little protein
or fats in vegetation, it is not part of an optimal diet for us whether
fermented, raw or cooked. Eating raw or fermented vegetables regularly
is not balanced.

## Good

Occasionally eating fermented vegetables supplies bacteria and enzymes
to help our bodies detoxify and eliminate old cooked vegetable residues
and byproducts, including all of the crystallized vegetable oils that
cause hardening of arteries and heart.

## Bad

Eating raw vegetables or raw fermented vegetables with raw meat causes
neutralization of the acidic bacteria and digestive juices for proper
digestion of meats, eggs and dairy.

## Stinky

Eating fermented vegetables on a diet with raw eggs and raw meat often
causes offensively odorous gases.
