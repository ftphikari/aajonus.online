# Why Do Most Physicians Refuse Chemo-treatments?

Chemo does not warrant being called therapy so I will refrain from using
that misnomer.

McGill Cancer Center polled 118 doctors and medical scientists
recently. Answers to the questionnaires show that 3 of every 4 doctors
and medical scientists would refuse chemo-treatments for themselves
because of the devastating effects.

Even though doctors are forced to sell chemo as life-extending, polled
doctors and scientists noted that refusal to accept chemo for themselves
was predicated on the fact that there are very very low incidences of
cancer reversal (remission) with chemo and that those few remissions
cannot be directly accredited to chemo-treatments. Most of the doctors
who would refuse chemo for themselves stated that they would not allow
their family members to suffer chemo either.
